-- Flair causes issue with pipenv so used conda virtual env
-- created conda virtual env using python 3.7 purposely
-- created conda from Pycharm preferences area 
-- first install pytorch using plus sign and selecting conda env
-- initiated pycharm from anaconda navigator and then opening project from pycharm once it is open
-- Use command pip install flair and it works
-- while creating requirements.txt some of the packages were getting references from conda virtual env.
   for ex:numpy @ file:///C:/ci/numpy_and_numpy_base_1596215850360/work
   to overcome this I used
   pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt to create requirement file
