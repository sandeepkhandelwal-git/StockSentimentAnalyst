-- Flair causes issue with pipenv so used conda virtual env
-- created conda virtual env using python 3.7 purposely
-- created conda from Pycharm preferences area 
-- first install pytorch using plus sign and selecting conda env
-- initiated pycharm from anaconda navigator and then opening project from pycharm once it is open
-- Use command pip install flair and it works
